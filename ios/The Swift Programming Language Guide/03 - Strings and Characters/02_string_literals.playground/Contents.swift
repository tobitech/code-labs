// MARK: - Special Characters in String Literals
/// String literals can include the following special characters:
/// The escaped characters:
//  \0 - (null character)
//  \\ - (backslash character)
//  \t - (horizontal tab)
//  \n - (line feed)
//  \r - (carriage return)
//  \" - (double quotation mark)
//  \' - (single quotation mark)
/// An arbitrary unicode character \u{n}, where n is a 1-8 digit hexadecimal number
// Examples:
let wiseWords = "\"Imagination is more important than knowledge\" - Einstein"

let dollarSign = "\u{24}"  // $,  Unicode scalar U+0024
let blackHeart = "\u{2665}" // â™¥,  Unicode scalar U+2665
let sparklingHeart = "\u{1F496}"  // ðŸ’–, Unicode scalar U+1F496

/// To include the text """ in a multiline string, escape at least one of the quotation marks.
/// For example:
let threeDoubleQuotationMarks = """
Escaping the first quotation mark \"""
Escaping all three quotation marks \"\"\"

// MARK: - Extended String Delimiters
/// You can place a string literal within extended delimiters to include special characters in a string without invoking their effect.

// print("Line 1\nLine 2")

/// If you need the special effects of a character in a string literal, match the number of number signs within the string following the escape character (\).
// print(#"Line 1\#nLine 2"#)
print(###"Line1\###nLine2"###) // does the same as above
