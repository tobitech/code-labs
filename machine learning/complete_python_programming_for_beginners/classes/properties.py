# this kind of code above is what a Java programmer learning python writes ðŸ˜‚

    price = property(__get_price, __set_price)


product = Product(10)

# # we can also set the price
product.price = -1  # this returns an exception though

print(product.price)  # we can read the price attribute with this property

# instead of explicitly calling the property function in the solution above
# we can apply the `@property` decorator to get_price method
# and apply `@price.setter` decorator to the set_price method
# the price part of it is the name of our property
