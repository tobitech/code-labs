/*
 Swift’s String and Character types provide a fast,
 Unicode-compliant way to work with text in your code.
 
 NOTE

 Swift’s String type is bridged with Foundation’s NSString class.
 Foundation also extends String to expose methods defined by NSString.
 This means, if you import Foundation, you can access those NSString methods on String without casting.

 For more information about using String with Foundation and Cocoa,
 see Bridging Between String and NSString.
