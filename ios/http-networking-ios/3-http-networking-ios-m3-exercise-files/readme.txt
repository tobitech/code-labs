This module introduces a few alternative implementations.

The "Before" folder is the state of the ChatCave Xcode project
before either alternative is implemented.

The "basic-authentication" folder contains a version of the ChatCave
Xcode project with HTTP Basic Authentication implemented using the
NSURLConnection class and its delegate methods.

The "api-key-auth" folder contains a version of the ChatCave Xcode
project that implements a custom authentication protocol using the
NSURLConnection class and its delegate methods.
