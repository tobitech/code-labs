/*
 Commong Operators and Terminologies:
 
 An operator is a special symbol or phrase that you use to `check`, `change`, or `combine` values.
 */

/// The assignment operator (=)

/// The equal to operator (==)

/// Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, % and so forth)

/// Swift also provides range operators that aren’t found in C, such as a..<b and a...b, as a shortcut for expressing a range of values.

/// This chapter describes the common operators in Swift.
/// Advanced Operators covers Swift’s advanced operators,
/// and describes how to define your own custom operators
/// and implement the standard operators for your own custom types.


// MARK: - Terminology
/// Operators are unary, binary, or ternary:

/// Unary operators operate on a single target (such as -a).
/// Unary prefix operators appear immediately before their target (such as !b), and unary postfix operators appear immediately after their target (such as c!).


/// Binary operators operate on two targets (such as 2 + 3) and are infix because they appear in between their two targets.
/// Ternary operators operate on three targets. Like C, Swift has only one ternary operator, the ternary conditional operator (a ? b : c).

/// The values that operators affect are operands. In the expression 1 + 2, the + symbol is a binary operator and its two operands are the values 1 and 2.
