x = 1
y = 1.1

# a + bi  # complex numbers, where i is an imaginary number.
# we use `j` in python syntax to represent the imaginary number
z = 1 + 2j

# standard arithmetic math operations
print(10 + 3)  # addition
print(10 - 3)  # substraction
print(10 * 3)  # multiplication
print(10 / 3)  # division - returns a floating point number
print(10 // 3)  # returns an integer
print(10 % 3)  # modulus - returns remainder of the division
print(10 ** 3)  # exponent - left side to the power of right side

# augmented assignment operator
x = 10
x = x + 3  # say we want to increment the value of x by 3
x += 3  # shorter syntax with augmented assignment operator
# you can use any of the operators above in the augmented assignment operator
